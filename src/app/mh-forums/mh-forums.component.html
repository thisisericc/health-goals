  <p-card header="Useful Information about Eating Disorders">
    <p>What is an Eating Disorder? 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is a phrase that describes a condition in which an individual engages in disordered eating. 
        Eating disorders are not simply poor eating habits but are recognised mental health disorders in which emotional issues manifest in harmful eating habits. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The three most common eating disorders are anorexia nervosa (anorexia), bulimia nervosa (bulimia), and binge eating disorder. Though each of these disorders result in different eating behaviours, each occurs when sufferers can not separate their emotions from their eating habits and this skews the way, and the amount, that they eat.
